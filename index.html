            <p>The team members gathered in the <b>school’s conference room</b> and <strong>brainstorming ideas for the project</strong>. The project aims to provide a fun and interactive learning experience for students.</p>
            <p>The team discussed the <i>project’s objectives</i> and the <em>resources that would be required</em> to achieve them. They also discussed the project’s timeline and budget constraints. </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>After going through a number of ideas and discarding some of them, the team finally settled on the idea of creating a virtual field trip that would enable students to explore the world of the animal kingdom. They decided to design the project
                to be interactive and educational, allowing students to experience virtual animal encounters through <span>3D and AR technology.</span></p>

                <p>Paragraph 2: The school programming project requires the involvement of various stakeholders, including faculty, students, and parents. Throughout the project, it is my job to ensure that all of the stakeholders are engaged in the decision-making
                    process and their feedback is taken into consideration. To that end, I have developed a detailed communication plan to ensure that the project is well-coordinated and all stakeholders are on the same page.</p>
                <p>
                    Paragraph 3: In order to ensure that the project stays on budget, it is my responsibility to track the project's progress and make adjustments as necessary. To that end, I have put in place a detailed financial tracking system that allows me to quickly
                    identify any potential issues and address them accordingly.
